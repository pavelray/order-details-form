# React Multi Step Form Example

This is a basic react application to create a multi step form. In this application I handled the state in each step component level. I have also added basic validation for each form on form submit.

MASTER-BRANCH : This branch has basic React code. State is handled in each step component level.

REDUX-1 : This branch has the code of implementing Redux and state is handled using store.

REDUX-2 : This branch has the code of using combinedReducer and API integration. Saving the form data at final step.
